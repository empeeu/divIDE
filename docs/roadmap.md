# Road Map

## TODO:
* Document panel development
* Document usage from user side
* Document api for developers

## MINOR TODOS:
* ~~Port three.js point-cloud example to divIDE and make it a panel~~
   * Sort out bugs for saving panels

## KNOWN BUGS:
* When creating a layout, and deleting some panels. Upon restoring the layout, it likely that the datalinks may be broken? It is likely that something that relies on nPanels will be broken.
