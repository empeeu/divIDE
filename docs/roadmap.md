# Road Map

## TODO:
* ~~Document panel development~~
* Document usage from user side
* ~~Document api for developers~~

## MINOR TODOS:

## KNOWN BUGS:
* When creating a layout, and deleting some panels. Upon restoring the layout, it likely that the datalinks may be broken? It is likely that something that relies on nPanels will be broken. 
* When restoring a layout, if a panel size is set as `px` it may not be restored properly with that specified size.
