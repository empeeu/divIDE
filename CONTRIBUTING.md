# Contributing
 
Thank you for considering contributing to the project! 

Please read the contributing guidelines below.

## Contribue Code!

Please fork this repository and make improvements! We welcome pull requests to add functionality and fix bugs. Please try to keep pull requests small, if possible. It is always better create two smaller pull requests than on big one.

## Style

*Style considerations to be added*

## Reporting an Issue

If you have a question on how something works, or its expected functionality, please first read the [developer docs](documentation/developguide/README.md) and the [TabSINT user guide](documentation/developguide/)

If you think you have found a bug, please start by making sure it hasn't already been reported on the [issues page]([add-repo]/issues?state=open). You can search through existing issues to see if a similar bug report has already been filed.

If not, [create a new issue]([add-repo]/issues), with the `bug` label, that briefly explains the problem, and provides a bit of background as to the circumstances that triggered it. Please do not group multiple topics into one issue, but instead each should be its own issue.

## Making a Feature Request

If you have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been requested on the [issues page]([add-repo]/labels/feature%20request). You can search through existing feature requests to see if a similar feature has already been requested.

If not, [create a new issue]([add-repo]/issues), with the `feature request` label, that describes the feature. Please do not group multiple topics into one request, but instead each should be its own issue.
