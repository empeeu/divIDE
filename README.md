# DivIDE

***divIDE*** is a javascript panel-management library. 

Many GUI applications have multiple panels/panes/windows where graphics/buttons/toolbars are displayed. ***divIDE*** allows these divisions in a window to be created an managed. Each panel, then, can be a type, like a textarea, a websocket, a 3D pointcloud viewer, or any user-defined plug-in. Consequently, divIDE helps streamline the process of developed IDE's that use `html` `div` elements to divide the browser window. 

## Quick Start

**divIDE** benefits from these dependencies installed on your machine globally:

- Python > 2.7.x, or 3.5.x
- [Node](nodejs.org) > 6

After cloning the repository, you can install all the development dependencies using the Node Package Manager (`npm`). Open a terminal in the root of the repository and run: 

```
$ npm install
```

To run the application in your local browser, open a terminal in the root of the repository and run: 

```
$ npm run serve
```

This will open a live-reload server in the `www` directory
