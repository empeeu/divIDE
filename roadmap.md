TODO:
* ~~Make the divs resizable~~
* ~~Make an export capability (so a layout can be saved)~~
* ~~Fix the context menu so that we do not have to make 50 copies~~
* make an import capability (so the layout can be restored)
    * Need to design a file structure for that -- possibly json, likely json
* Need to design the structure for a ~~content box~~ panel 
    * main panel ~~content box~~ should be for a ~~container~~ layout panel
      and that will show up 
      when the edit layout is active for all ~~containers~~ panels and it is the
      default for all ~~containers~~ panels
* should be easy to add new ~~content boxes~~ panels by just including the
  javascript or something like that... 
* ~~Need to add nicer interface for making new divs~~
    * ~~Plus on the left~~
    * ~~minus on the right~~
    * ~~size in the middle~~
* As a proof of concept, add a text box
* As a proof of concept, add a line plot box
* Sort out the data sharing between the text box and the plot box
* Sort out websockets?
