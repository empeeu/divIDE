TODO:
* ~~Make the divs resizable~~
* Make an export capability (so a layout can be saved)
* make an import capability (so the layout can be restored)
    * Need to design a file structure for that -- possibly json, likely json
* Need to design the structure for a content box 
    * first content box should be for a container, and that will show up 
      when the edit layout is active for all containers and it is the
      default for all containers
* should be easy to add new content boxes by just including the javascript or
  something like that... 
* Need to add nicer interface for making new divs 
    * Plus on the left
    * minus on the right
    * size in the middle
